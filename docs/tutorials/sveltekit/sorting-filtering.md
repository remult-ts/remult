# Paging, Sorting and Filtering

The RESTful API created by Remult supports **server-side paging, sorting, and filtering**. Let's use that to limit, sort and filter the list of tasks.

## Limit Number of Fetched Tasks

Since our database may eventually contain a lot of tasks, it make sense to use a **paging strategy** to limit the number of tasks retrieved in a single fetch from the back-end database.

Let's limit the number of fetched tasks to `20`.

In the `load` function inside our `+page.server.ts`, pass an `options` argument to the `find` method call and set its `limit` property to 20.

```ts
// src/routes/+page.server.ts

export const load = async () => {
  ...
  const tasks = await taskRepo.find({limit: 20});
)
```

Depending on the number of tasks that you have added, you may not have enough tasks in the database for this change to have an immediate visible effect, but it will have one later on when we add more tasks.

::: tip
Using `limit` only returns the first page of data. To query subsequent pages, use the [Repository.find()](../../docs/ref_repository.md#find) method's `page` option.

## Sorting By Creation Date

We would like old tasks to appear first in the list, and new tasks to appear last. Let's sort the tasks by their `createdAt` field.

Set the `orderBy` property of the `find` method call's `option` argument to an object that contains the fields you want to sort by.
Use "asc" and "desc" to determine the sort order.

```ts
// src/routes/+page.server.ts

export const load = async () => {
  ...
  const tasks = await taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }
    });
)
```

## Filtering

Remult supports sending filter rules to the server to query only the tasks that we need.

Adjust the `load` function to fetch only `completed` tasks.

```ts
// src/routes/+page.server.ts

export const load = async () => {
  ...
  const tasks = await taskRepo
    .find({
      limit: 20,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" },
      where: { completed: true }
    });
)
```

::: warning NOTE:
Because the `completed` field is of type `boolean`, the argument is **compile-time checked to be of the `boolean` type**. Settings the `completed` filter to `undefined` causes it to be ignored by Remult.
:::

## Dynamic Data Using the Query String
In Sveltekit, the `load` function has access to the HTTP query string via the [`url.searchParams`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#using-url-data-url). Let's use this feature to allow for dynamic querrying of our tasks using the query string.

The object passed into `find` are of type `FindOptions`. It can be composed outside the function and then passed in. Modify your `+page.server.ts` to match this:

```ts
// src/routes/+page.server.ts

import { remult, type FindOptions } from "remult";
import { Task } from "../shared/Task";

const taskRepo = remult.repo(Task);

export const load = async ({ url }) => {
    const orderDir = url.searchParams.get("orderDir") || "asc";
    if (orderDir !== "asc" && orderDir !== "desc") orderDir = "asc";

    const completed = Boolean(url.searchParams.get("completed")) || undefined;

    const options: FindOptions<Task> = {
        orderBy: { createdAt: orderDir },
        limit: parseInt(url.searchParams.get("limit") || "20"),
        where: {
            completed,
        },
    };

    const tasks = await taskRepo.find(options);

    return {
        tasks: structuredClone(tasks),
    };
};
```
You can then pass in the filters via the query string:
- http://localhost:5173 (default)
- http://localhost:5173/?limit=5 (apply limit)
- http://localhost:5173/?orderDir=asc (oldest first)
- http://localhost:5173/?completed=true (use `completed=` without a value [or omit] to get all tasks)

Of course you can mix and match eg `?limit=5&completed=true` to get 5 completed tasks. Play with different filtering values.

Play with different filtering values, and eventually comment it out, since we do need all the tasks.

### Validating the Query String
It is important to validate input parameters to ensure safety and conformity; and to also coarce input data into an accepted format. In this example, we coarce `limit` to integer and `completed` into a boolean.

In Remult, the values in `orderBy` are exptected to be `"asc" | "desc" | undefined`. Even though it works, you may have noticed that Typescript is complaining because the input is not guaranteed to conform to this typing.

To validate `orderBy`, first check validity and then coarce it to placate Typescript:

```ts
  ...
  let orderDir = url.searchParams.get("orderDir") || "asc";
  if (orderDir !== "asc" && orderDir !== "desc") orderDir = "asc";
  ...
  const options: FindOptions<Task> = {
    orderBy: { createdAt: orderDir as "asc" | "desc" | undefined },
    ...
  }
  ...
```
