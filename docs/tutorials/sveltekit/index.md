# Build a Full-Stack SvelteKit Application

### Create a simple todo app with Remult using a SvelteKit

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple app to manage a task list. We'll use `SvelteKit` for the UI & the backend and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework.

By the end of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Remult and how to use it to accelerate and simplify full stack app development.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with `SvelteKit`.
