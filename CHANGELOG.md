## [0.22.3] - 2023-08-02

## [0.22.2] - 2023-07-30

## [0.22.1] - 2023-07-25

- Fixed issue [#215](https://github.com/remult/remult/issues/215) support for mongo without transactions

## [0.22.0] - 2023-07-16

- Added `ToJson` and `FromJson` methods the the `Repository` object. These are extremely useful in the context of SSR (next etc...) where you need to send plain json over the wire, but still want to have dates and other cool stuff in your app
- Fixed an issue with the many-to-one relation where the 'many' table did not store the ID as an 'integer' in cases where the 'one' table's ID column was an integer
- Fixed issue where using displayValue or validate on a spread object, marked it as new, and always triggered a post call
- Added Remult.run
- isBackend will return true or false based on dataProvider.isProxy equal false or runningOnServer member
- Backend method will call backend based on isBackend method,
- Replaced deprecated cuid with `paralleldrive/cuid2`
- Fixed an issue where when `getDb` was called without a `remult` parameter, it wouldn't use the default remult
- Fixed liveQuery's apply changes to also support state that it's initial value is undefined.
- Typescript 5 style decorators are now supported in development, but to deploy you still need `experimentalDecorators` .
  - Also, the decorators now do type checking, so if you put @Fields.string() on a number, it'll give you an error
  - And - no longer need for the Generics in the decorators setting.
    - `@Entity<Task>(...)` is now `@Entity(...)`
    - `@Fields.string<Task>(...)` is now `@Fields.string(...)`
  - Why didn't we implement typescript 5 decorators in runtime? the implementation for that is not yet fully supported with tools such as esbuild etc... so implementing it is trying to hit a moving target.
    At this time we recommend using `experimentalDecorator:false` for development, to get the typing, but `experimentalDecorator:true` for deploying and functionality.
- Added 404 on missing route for next app router - issue #211
- Fixed an issue where live query would not unsubscribe automatically to a query that failed to fetch.
- Fixed an issue where, when using the cache with findId or findFirst, and requesting to load fields, if the cache contained a row without those fields, it would return the cached row without those fields.
- Fixed an issue where in a filter that contained multiple instances of the same custom filter, with an 'and' condition did not work correctly
- Graphql Mutations now display validation errors in the graphql way

## [0.21.1] - 2023-06-25

## [0.21.0] - 2023-06-22

- Added support for `next.js` App Router. See [Add remult to your project](https://remult.dev/docs/add-remult-to-your-app.html#next-js-app-router)

## [0.19.0] - 2023-03-26

- `Repository`
  - Added a `validate` method that returns an `ErrorInfo` object if invalid.
  - Added a `fields` member that can be used to access the metadata of specific fields, for example:
    ```ts
    repo.fields.title.caption
    //or
    repo.fields.title.inputType
    ```
  - The `insert`, `validate`, `create`, `save` and `update` value will now run `fromJson` and `toJson` for field values that do not match their type - for consistent behavior with the `api`
- `FieldMetadata`
  - Added `apiUpdateAllowed` to query if `update` is allowed for this field
  - Added `includedInApi` to query of this field would be returned from the backend as part of the api
  - Added `displayValue` that can be used to achieve a consistent way a field is displayed.
  - Added `toInput` and `fromInput` methods that'll help with translating values from and to inputs.
- `getId` method added to `IdMetadata` to enable extracting the id from immutable objects, this is mainly useful for entities where the `id` column is not called `id` :)
  ```ts
  repo.metadata.idMetadata.getId(task)
  ```
-

### Breaking Changes

- In `EntityMetadata` the `apiUpdateAllowed`, `apiDeleteAllowed` and `apiInsertAllowed` that previously were boolean fields, are now methods that accepts item and return true or false. This is useful for cases where the apiAllowed rules refer to the specific values of an entity.
  ```ts
  // Previously
  if (repo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed) {
  }
  // Now
  if (repo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task)) {
  }
  ```
- The `validate` method in `EntityRef` and `ControllerRef` that previously returned true if valid, now returns `undefined` if valid and `ErrorInfo` if invalid
- `FieldMetadata`'s `ValueConverter` field's members are now mandatory and no longer optional - it's expected that they'll be implemented
